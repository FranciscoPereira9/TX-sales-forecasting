Forecasting Walmart’s number of sold products. Final project and competition for the course: Applied Forecasting in Complex Systems at UvA.

Forecasting product demand is a challenging concept due to the change and irregularities in demand. .
We investigated three types of models:

The deep learning model performed best with an RMSE of 3.359.
